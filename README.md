## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vakay-trip-planner-project # Or your project's root folder
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1.  Go to the [Supabase website](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  Once your project is created, navigate to the **SQL Editor** from the left sidebar.
3.  Copy the entire content of the following files from the root of this repository and run them in the SQL editor in this specific order:
    1.  `schema.sql`
    2.  `profiles.sql`
    3.  `policies.sql`

    This will set up the necessary tables, user profile triggers, and security policies.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1.  In your Supabase project, go to **Project Settings** > **API**.
2.  Find your **Project URL** and **Project API keys** (`anon` `public` key).
3.  In the `vakay-trip-planner` directory of your local project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
4.  Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies and Run the App

1.  Navigate to the frontend application's directory:
    ```bash
    cd vakay-trip-planner
    ```
2.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The database is composed of the following tables:

-   `trips`: Stores the core information for each trip (name, destination, dates).
-   `locations`: Stores locations associated with a trip, including a name, color, and description.
-   `itinerary_days`: Represents a single day in a trip's itinerary, with notes, a summary, and linked locations.
-   `trip_participants`: A junction table that links users to trips and defines their role (`admin` or `traveler`).
-   `profiles`: Stores public user data like full name and avatar URL, linked to the `auth.users` table.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `/`: The root directory contains the SQL files for setting up the Supabase database.
-   `/vakay-trip-planner`: This directory contains the Next.js frontend application.
